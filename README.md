# Extracting and Loading from Public API into bigquery table
1. Extract and load data into bigquery in GCP from public API
2. Set it as a job to run every 4 hour.
    - Use a linux cron job in compute-engine instance ( preferred)
    - Set up schedule in cloud scheduler and run as cloud function (May take extra effort and more expensive)
